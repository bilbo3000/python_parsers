autocomplete.ungrab_during_mode_switch
(X11 only) This option complements autocomplete.grab_during_popup. If both preferences are true, then during an autocomplete session the application will release/grab keyboard when a mode-switch key is pressed/released.
If either of these two preferences is false, then the application will not release keyboard grab during an autocomplete session.
The default value is true.
Setting this preference dynamically takes effect in the next autocomplete session.
