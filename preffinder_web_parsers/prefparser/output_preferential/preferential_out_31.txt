autocomplete.grab_during_popup
(X11 only) Specify if the autocomplete pop-up control should grab the keyboard. This option can be set to false to work around the bug where XKB does not set mode switching properly.
The default value is true.
Setting this preference dynamically takes effect in the next autocomplete session.
