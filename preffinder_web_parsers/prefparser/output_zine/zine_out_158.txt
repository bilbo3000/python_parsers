browser.tabs.loadDivertedInBackground
Determines behavior of pages normally meant to open in a new window (such as
target="_blank"
or from an external program), but that have instead been loaded in a new tab.
True
: Load the new tab in the background, leaving focus on the current tab
False
(default): Load the new tab in the foreground, taking the focus from the current tab.
Note: Setting this preference to
True
will still bring the browser to the front when opening links from outside the browser.
Note:
target="_new"
creates/reuses a window named "_new" and is frequently used by Google.
target="_blank"
loads the designated document in a new, unnamed window [
[1]
].
