network.http.keep-alive
Determines whether to use HTTP Keep-Alive connections. If more than one request is made, the browser attempts to reuse open connections that have been kept alive.
True
(default): Send
Connection: keep-alive
header and
Keep-Alive
header based on contents of
network.http.keep-alive.timeout
False
: Opposite of the above (recommended in case of problems)
Note: This preference is effectively obsolete, as all connections are considered keep-alive in HTTP/1.1.
