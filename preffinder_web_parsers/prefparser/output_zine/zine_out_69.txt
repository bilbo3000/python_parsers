browser.download.manager.useWindow
True
: Use the Download Manager window for downloads
False
: Opposite of the above
Note: In Firefox, this is effectively the same as setting
browser.download.manager.showWhenStarting
to false; the Download Manager is used for downloads regardless of the setting.
Note: This was removed in

for Firefox 3.1.
