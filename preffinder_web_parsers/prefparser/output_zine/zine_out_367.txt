network.ntlm.send-lm-response
Determines whether or not the LM hash will be included in response to a NTLM challenge. Servers should almost never need the LM hash, and the LM hash is what makes NTLM authentication less secure.
True
: Send the LM hash
False
(default): Opposite of the above
Note: Does not affect
network.automatic-ntlm-auth.*
settings. See
bug 250961
for more information.
