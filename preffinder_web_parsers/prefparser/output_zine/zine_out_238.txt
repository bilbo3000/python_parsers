extensions.autoDisableScopes
"Extension scopes" where newly installed addons are disabled by default (Gecko 7 and later since 2011-06-28, see
bug 666437
). This is an additive bit field:
1 = addons found in this profile (this bit is probably masked off)
2 = addons applying to all profiles of this user
4 = addons applying to all users of this application
8 = addons (e.g. plug-ins) applying to anyone on this computer
Default varies among versions: Undefined (no disabling, as with 0), 10 (all except app-global and user-profile), 15 (all, but does not apply to some specific locations such as IIUC
installdir
/extensions/ and
profiledir
/extensions/)
