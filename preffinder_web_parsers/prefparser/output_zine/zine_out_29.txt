browser.chrome.image_icons.max_size
If an image's height or width is greater than this number (in pixels), the image will not have a thumbnail placed in its tab (or the
Location Bar
). Setting it to
0
will prevent thumbnails from being used altogether. The default value is
1024
pixels.
Note: Firefox 1.5 and above and SeaMonkey only.
