dom.event.contextmenu.enabled
Determines whether the
oncontextmenu
event can be caught by non-chrome
JavaScript
(e.g., in an anti-right-click script).
True
(default): the opposite of below.
False
: Webpages will not be able to affect the context menu event, thus allowing to access the context menu all the time.
Note: In Firefox, this can be changed via "
Tools → Options
→ Content (Web Features in Firefox 1.0.x) → Advanced → Allow scripts to: Disable or replace context menus" and, in Mozilla Suite, via "Edit → Preferences → Advanced → Scripts
Plug-ins → Allow scripts to: Disable or replace context menus".
